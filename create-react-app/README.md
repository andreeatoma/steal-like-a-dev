[create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) is the most popular way of starting a React project, so it's only fitting I'll start the series with this.

Here you'll find a Webpack config + Service Worker which mimics `development` & `production` builds of create-react-app. So if you're curious how could to set up a React project without cra, have you've come to the right place :)

PS: the only thing missing is the testing part. This is not one of my strong points so I decided it's better to leave it out.
