# react-redux | steal-like-a-dev

Minimalist implementation of [react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) and [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux). This is an "all-in-one" package, containining functions from both libraries so that it's compatible with React apps.

Primarily for teaching purposes in my [StealLikeADev.com](https://StealLikeADev.com) tutorial series.

These docs are "stolen" from these 2 libraries, but I've left only the parts I've implemented in this package. Enjoy!
