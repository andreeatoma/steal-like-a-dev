# react-router | steal-like-a-dev

Minimalist implementation of [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). Primarily for teaching purposes in my [StealLikeADev.com](https://StealLikeADev.com) tutorial series, BUT since it's actually very usable, I decided to publish it as a [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@steal-like-a-dev/react-router) as well.

These docs are "stolen" from react-router, but I've left only the parts I've actually implemented. Happy stealing!


## Installation & usage

`$ npm install @steal-like-a-dev/react-router`

```javascript
import { Route, Link, Redirect, Switch } from '@steal-like-a-dev/react-router';
```

## API

### [~~`<BrowserRouter>`~~](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/BrowserRouter)

I specifically built just this routing method - using normal URL's instead of hashes - so no need for this component.

### [`<Route>`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route)

#### component

A React component to render only when the location matches. It will be rendered with route props.

#### path: string | string[]

Any valid URL path or array of paths.

! Routes without a path always match.

#### exact: boolean

When true, will only match if the path matches the location.pathname exactly.

### [`<Link>`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link)

#### to: string

A string representation of the Link location, created by concatenating the locationâ€™s pathname, search, and hash properties.

#### to: object

An object that can have any of the following properties:

* **pathname**: A string representing the path to link to.
* **search**: A string representation of query parameters.
* **hash**: A hash to put in the URL, e.g. #a-hash.
* **state**: State to persist to the location

#### to: function 

A function to which current location is passed as an argument and which should return location representation as a string or as an object


#### replace: boolean

When true, clicking the link will replace the current entry in the history stack instead of adding a new one.


### [`<Redirect>`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Redirect)

#### to: string

The URL to redirect to

#### to: object

* **pathname**: A string representing the path to redirect to to.
* **search**: A string representation of query parameters.
* **hash**: A hash to put in the URL, e.g. #a-hash.
* **state**: State to persist to the location


#### push: bool

When true, redirecting will push a new entry onto the history instead of replacing the current one.

#### from: string

Only redirect when on this current pathname. 

#### exact: bool

This can only be used in conjunction with from to exactly match a location from which to redirect.

### [`<Switch>`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Switch)

Renders the first `<Route>` or `<Redirect>` that matches the location.

**How is this different than just using a bunch of `<Route>`s?**

`<Switch>` is unique in that it renders a route exclusively. In contrast, every <Route> that matches the location renders inclusively. Consider these routes:

## Test project

As you can see, there's also a test project included in this repo. You can run it with

`npm run test:dev` 

  or 

`npm run test:prod`
