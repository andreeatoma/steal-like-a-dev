# styled-components | steal-like-a-dev

Minimalist implementation of [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components). Primarily for teaching purposes in my [StealLikeADev.com](https://StealLikeADev.com), BUT since it's pretty useful (if you don't need all the original features), I decided to publish it as a [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@steal-like-a-dev/styled-components) as well.

These docs are "stolen" from styled-components, but I've left only the parts I've actually implemented. Happy stealing!

## Installation & usage

`$ npm install @steal-like-a-dev/styled-components`

```javascript
import styled, { css, keyframes } from '@steal-like-a-dev/styled-components';
```
